        <div class="general-content">
            <p class="p-content">Roller coaster elements are the distinct track features that shape a ride’s pacing,
                forces, and overall thrill. Common elements include drops, which build speed and momentum; airtime
                hills, which create moments of weightlessness; and banked turns or helices that generate sustained
                lateral or rotational forces. Inversions—such as loops, corkscrews, and rolls—flip riders upside-down
                and add dynamic visual appeal. Modern coasters often incorporate more advanced elements like launches
                for rapid acceleration, stall or zero-g rolls for controlled floating sensations, and beyond-vertical
                drops for dramatic intensity. Together, these elements combine to create each coaster’s unique rhythm,
                blending physics and design to deliver a memorable ride experience.</p>

                <h1>Vertical Loop</h1>
                <div class="content-item-items">
                    <p>A vertical loop is a classic roller coaster inversion shaped like an upright oval or circle that
                        sends riders fully upside-down as they travel through it. Coasters enter the loop with enough speed
                        to generate centripetal force, which keeps riders pressed safely into their seats even at the top
                        when they’re inverted. The loop typically has a teardrop shape—wider at the bottom and tighter at
                        the top—to balance comfort and force, reducing the intense g-forces that older, perfectly circular
                        loops once produced. This element creates a smooth, continuous feeling of acceleration and is often
                        one of the most recognizable and iconic features of a roller coaster.</p>

                    <p>A dive loop is a roller coaster inversion that begins with the train twisting riders upside-down and
                        then diving downward into a steep, spiraling drop. Typically, the element starts with a twist that
                        tips the train onto its side and eventually inverts it, after which the track curves sharply
                        downward in a half-loop motion. This combination of rotation and plunge creates a disorienting,
                        thrilling sensation as riders are flipped and then pulled into a fast descent. Dive loops are
                        commonly found on looping coasters, especially B&M models, and they add a dynamic mix of inversion
                        and rapid directional change to a ride’s pacing.</p>

                <h1>Immelmann Loop</h1>
                <div class="content-item-items">
                    <p>An Immelmann loop is a roller coaster inversion that combines a half-loop with a half-twist, creating
                        a smooth upward flip followed by a change in direction. The train first rises into a steep,
                        upward-curving half-loop that inverts the riders. At the top, instead of continuing the loop, the
                        track twists the train upright while turning it 180 degrees, sending it out in the opposite
                        direction from which it entered. This maneuver produces a moment of weightlessness at the crest and
                        delivers a dynamic blend of inversion, height, and directional reversal. Inspired by an aerial
                        combat maneuver, the Immelmann loop adds both visual spectacle and sharp, controlled motion to a
                        coaster’s layout.</p>

                <h1>Zero-G Roll</h1>
                <div class="content-item-items">
                    <img class="img-properties" id="zero-g" src="./images/zero-g.png" alt="Wicked's zero-g roll">
                    <p>A zero-g roll is a roller coaster inversion designed to create a brief moment of complete
                        weightlessness as the train twists along the track. The element typically starts with the train
                        rising slightly, then rolling a full 360 degrees along a straight or gently arcing path. During the
                        roll, the forces are carefully balanced so riders feel as if they are floating freely—experiencing
                        “zero gravity”—rather than being pushed into their seats. This produces a smooth, airy sensation
                        that contrasts with more forceful inversions. Zero-g rolls are popular on many modern coasters for
                        their graceful motion and unique, floaty thrill.</p>
