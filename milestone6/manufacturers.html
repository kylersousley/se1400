            <p class="p-content" id="p-content-smaller-text">Roller coaster manufacturers are specialized companies that
                design and build the wide
                variety of coasters found in theme parks around the world, each bringing its own engineering style,
                innovations, and signature ride experiences. Well-known manufacturers like Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M),
                Intamin, and Vekoma produce large-scale steel coasters known for their smoothness, speed, and complex
                elements. Others, such as Great Coasters International (GCI) and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC),
                focus on wooden and hybrid coasters that emphasize airtime and dynamic, twisting layouts. Manufacturers
                differ in their approaches to track design, train technology, launch systems, and restraint mechanics,
                reflecting decades of research, safety advancements, and evolving ride trends. Together, these companies
                shape the global coaster landscape, continually pushing the boundaries of engineering and imagination to
                deliver new and unique thrills.</p>

                    <p>Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) is an American roller coaster manufacturer known for
                        revolutionizing wooden coaster design through innovative engineering and hybrid track
                        technology. The company gained worldwide attention with its patented I-Box track, which replaces
                        traditional wooden rails with smooth steel while retaining the wooden support structure,
                        allowing for extreme elements, inversions, and high-intensity maneuvers previously impossible on
                        wood coasters. RMC is also known for its Topper Track system, which enhances the smoothness and
                        longevity of traditional wooden coasters. Their creations are celebrated for delivering strong
                        airtime, rapid transitions, and highly dynamic layouts that blend intensity with surprising
                        smoothness. With a bold design philosophy and a reputation for transforming older rides into
                        modern standouts, RMC has become one of the most influential and admired manufacturers in the
                        industry.</p>

                        pioneering several major coaster types such as the inverted coaster, the sit-down and stand-up
                        looping coasters, and the iconic flying and wing coaster models. Their rides are known for wide,
                        graceful layouts, strong yet controlled forces, and exceptionally comfortable train and
                        restraint systems. Parks value B&M’s consistency, reliability, and low maintenance needs, while
