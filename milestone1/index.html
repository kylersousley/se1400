        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>I want this site to contain information about rollercoasters, such as different types of rollercoasters, general basic physics behind them, information on how their systems work, pages for different rollercoasters that exist out there and general info about them specifically, etc. I also was to include a list of rollercoasters I personally have been on, as well as my top 10 ranking of them.</p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>I plan on getting images either from the internet and from personal pictures I have gathered over the years. For the information, I will be using the general knowledge I have gained about this topic over the years, and by doing further research if there is any more knowledge I need to obtain.</p>

            <p>Because its nice to have a place where users can research about topics of interest (in thise case being rollercoasters), as well as there being information out there about how certain safety systems for on these machines, to clear up any misconceptions/misinformation that can spread about them.</p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>I would like users to be able to explore different rollercoasters that exist and learn about them and how they work through an easy to navigate interface</p>
