        <h2>What works:</h2>
        <p>The competitor site I found is called CoasterForce, and I really liked how easy it was to navigate around the page. Everything was well organized and intuitive, the styling was nice and appealing, and the information was clear.</p>
        <h2>What I thought could have been different:</h2>
        <p>I noticed with some of the pages they had for certain sections, like physics and mechanics, they seemed to only have one page for multiple different subjects. However how I plan on going with my page is having different subjects have their own page, that way if someone is looking for a subject more specific, they can quickly find a page with just the desired information.</p>
