            <p class="p-content" id="p-content-smaller-text">Roller coaster restraints are safety systems designed to keep riders secure while
                allowing enough freedom of movement to experience the ride’s sensations comfortably. The most common
                types include lap bars, which rest over the rider’s lower body and are often used on coasters focused on
                airtime or smooth maneuvers, and over-the-shoulder restraints (OTSRs), which provide upper-body security
                for rides with intense inversions or rapid directional changes. Many modern coasters use more ergonomic
                designs like soft vest-style restraints or articulated lap bars that minimize discomfort and headbanging
                while maintaining safety. Restraints are typically locked and monitored electronically, ensuring they
                fasten correctly before dispatch and remain secure throughout the ride. Together, these systems balance
                comfort, freedom, and protection, making it possible for riders to enjoy the full range of coaster
                elements confidently and safely.</p>

                <h1>Ratchet Restraints</h1>
                <p>Ratchet restraints use a mechanical pawl-and-gear system to lock securely into place as the rider
                    pulls the bar down. Inside the restraint mechanism is a notched metal gear (the ratchet) and a
                    spring-loaded pawl that drops into each tooth as the bar moves downward, creating the familiar
                    clicking sound. The pawl allows movement in only one direction—down—preventing the bar from lifting
                    back up unless the system is intentionally released by the ride operator. These mechanisms are
                    typically backed by hydraulic or electronic sensors that confirm the pawl is fully engaged before
                    the train can dispatch. Because each click corresponds to a fixed locking position, ratchet
                    restraints can accommodate varying body sizes while ensuring a strong, fail-safe hold throughout the
                    ride.</p>

            <div class="content-item">
                <h1>Hydraulic Restraints</h1>
                <p>Hydraulic restraints use pressurized fluid systems to create a smooth, adjustable, and highly secure
                    hold on riders. Instead of locking into fixed “clicks” like a ratchet restraint, a hydraulic
                    cylinder allows the restraint bar to move down freely but resist upward motion through fluid
                    pressure. When the bar is lowered, hydraulic valves direct fluid into chambers that create
                    increasing resistance, holding the bar firmly at whatever position it stops. This allows for
                    precise, custom fitment for each rider’s body shape without the incremental locking of a ratchet.
                    The system is monitored by pressure sensors that verify the restraint is within a safe operating
                    range before the ride can dispatch. Because of their smooth operation and consistent pressure,
                    hydraulic restraints are often used on coasters and thrill rides where comfort, flexibility, and
                    reliability are equally important.</p>
